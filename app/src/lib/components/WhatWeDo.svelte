<p class="principle">
	💡&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people just want to see the world learn. We believe: That works best in a friendly,
	collaborative environment without pressure. That is why Lightbulb Learning is about growth through
	understanding instead of grades through memorization.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	🥋&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightbulb Learning is a dialogue platform: it lets your students challenge each other by
	asking good open questions, answering them precisely and providing feedback for each others work - all of
	that being a part of their educational process and performance.
</p>

<p class="principle">
	📈&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe and evaluate your students path through the learning curve over weeks or months,
	because growth takes more time than a 90 minute exam.
